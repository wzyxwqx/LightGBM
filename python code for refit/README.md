Here are our python codes to achive online LightGBM.

Criteo Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/mrkmakr/criteo-dataset

The codes below are used for data preprocessing in kaggle kernel with dataset above as input:
dataset-generator.ipynb:generate 50% data of the train dataset.
dataset-generator-10.ipynb:generate 5 10% data of the train dataset.

The code below rileazes our three models. Notice that SIR model need to install LightGBM from this branch: UseOldDatasetInformation
train-lgbm.ipynb
